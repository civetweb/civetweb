/*
  Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

  This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
  text is available at
	http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
  The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
  (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
  any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
  copyrighted.

  The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
  <ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
  that follows (in reverse chronological order):

  2002-04-13 lpd Removed support for non-ANSI compilers; removed
	references to Ghostscript; clarified derivation from RFC 1321;
	now handles byte order either statically or dynamically.
  1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
  1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
	added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
	Purschke <purschke@bnl.gov>.
  1999-05-03 lpd Original version.

 * defined as non-zero, the code will be compiled to run only on big-endian
 * CPUs; if ARCH_IS_BIG_ENDIAN is not defined, the code will be compiled to
 * run on either big- or little-endian CPUs, but will run slightly less
 * efficiently on either one than if ARCH_IS_BIG_ENDIAN is defined.
