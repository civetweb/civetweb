Project Mission
-----------------

Project mission is to provide easy to use, powerful, C (C/C++) embeddable web server with optional CGI, SSL and Lua support.
CivetWeb has a MIT license so you can innovate without restrictions.

CivetWeb can be used by developers as a library, to add web server functionality to an existing application.

It can also be used by end users as a stand-alone web server running on a Windows or Linux PC. It is available as single executable, no installation is required.


Where to find the official version?
-----------------------------------

End users can download CivetWeb binaries / releases from here on GitHub [https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/releases](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/releases) or SourceForge
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/civetweb/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/civetweb/)

Developers can contribute to CivetWeb via GitHub
[https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb)

Due to a [bug in Git for Windows V2.24](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2435)
CivetWeb must be used with an earlier or later version (see also [here](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/issues/812)).

Bugs and requests should be filed on GitHub
[https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/issues](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/issues)

Source releases can be found on GitHub
[https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/releases](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/releases)

A very brief overview can be found on GitHub Pages

Overview
--------

CivetWeb keeps the balance between functionality and
simplicity by a carefully selected list of features:

- Forked from [Mongoose](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/) in 2013, before
  it changed the licence from MIT to commercial + GPL. A lot of enhancements
  have been added since then, see
  [RELEASE_NOTES.md](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md).
- Maintains the liberal, permissive, commercial-friendly,
  [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)
- Project is free from copy-left licenses, like GPL, because you should innovate without
  restrictions.
- Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, UNIX, IOS, Android, Buildroot, and many
  other platforms.
- Scripting and database support (CGI, Lua Server Pages, Server side Lua scripts, Lua SQLite database,
  Server side JavaScript).
  This provides a ready to go, powerful web development platform in a one
  single-click executable with **no dependencies**. 0
- Support for CGI, SSI, HTTP digest (MD5) authorization, WebSocket, WebDAV.
- Experimental HTTP/2 support.
- HTTPS (SSL/TLS) support using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).
- Optional support for authentication using client side X.509 certificates.
- Resumed download, URL rewrite, file blacklist, IP-based ACL.
- Can run as a Windows service or systemd service.
- Download speed limit based on client subnet or URI pattern.
- Simple and clean embedding API.
- The source is in single file for drop in compilation.
- Embedding examples included.
- HTTP client capable of sending arbitrary HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- Websocket client functionality available (WS/WSS).

Contributions
-------------

Contributions are welcome provided all contributions carry the MIT license.

DO NOT APPLY fixes copied from Mongoose to this project to prevent GPL tainting.
Since 2013, CivetWeb and Mongoose have been developed independently.
By now the code base differs, so patches cannot be safely transferred in either direction.

Some guidelines can be found in [docs/Contribution.md](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/blob/master/docs/Contribution.md).


Authors
-------

CivetWeb was forked from the last MIT version of Mongoose in August 2013.
Since then, CivetWeb has seen many improvements from various authors
(Copyright (c) 2013-2025 the CivetWeb developers, MIT license).

A list of authors can be found in [CREDITS.md](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/blob/master/CREDITS.md).

CivetWeb is based on the [Mongoose project](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose). The original author of Mongoose was
Sergey Lyubka(2004-2013) who released it under the MIT license.
However, on August 16, 2013,
[Mongoose was relicensed to a dual GPL V2 + commercial license](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mongoose-users/aafbOnHonkI)
and CivetWeb was created by Thomas Davis (sunsetbrew) as "the MIT fork of mongoose".
The license change and CivetWeb fork was mentioned on the Mongoose
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoose_(web_server))
page as well, but it's getting deleted (and added again) there every
now and then.

Using the CivetWeb project ensures the MIT licenses terms are applied and
GPL cannot be imposed on any of this code, as long as it is sourced from
here. This code will remain free with the MIT license protection.
